## üöÄ Overview

**Image Cropper** allows users to:
- Load a folder of images (JPEG, PNG)
- Create and edit **multiple crop versions** per image (e.g., 16:9, 1:1, etc.)
- Store all crop data in lightweight **JSON sidecar files**
- Export all versions at once with adjustable **JPEG quality** and **long-edge resize**

Built with **React (frontend)** for speed of development and **Rust (backend)** for native image processing performance.
